# Suraj Kandlakunta's Personal Portfolio. 

### Introduction.

I have built this webpage using HTML, CSS, and JS, and I haven't used any libraries from these technologies to do it, so it's all Vanilla script. However, I have used SASS/SCSS, a preprocessor scripting language, for the ease and simplicity of the CSS files. I have developed a custom design and color palette for this webpage. I have decided to display three of my best works in the works section of the webpage, though I have linked to my profile on frontendmentor.io, where I have completed most of my frontend challenges. 

### Responsive Design

I have tried to solve the problem of the responsiveness of the webpage by relying on the flex properties of different sections, adjusting them accordingly using the media queries. The flex properties like flex-direction, flex-wrap played a massive role in determining the responsiveness of the webpage. I have also used relative units for measurement purposes, which helps achieve suitable layouts at different screen widths. 

### JavaScript on the Webpage.

I have used JS to work with the dark-light mode toggle. I have used the query selector command to select the respective classes and have written a function that adds a class ".darkmode" to the body when clicked. Then I used the boolean functions IF and ELSE to write the functionality of the dark and light modes accordingly. And using the command "localStorage.getItem" ensured that the dark-light mode stayed intact even after refreshing the webpage multiple times. 

### MISC CSS 

I have used CSS to add subtle animations to various elements for better visual experiences. I have used the same to create a custom scrollbar following the dark-light modes.

### BLOG SECTION 

I have written a small walkthrough in the blogs section to give you an idea behind the technologies that I have used in building these webpages. The code for the blog section can be accessed on the blog section webpage itself.


PS: I have also referred to a few YouTube Videos in order to build these webpages.
